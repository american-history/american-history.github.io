# Contribution Guide

Please read the entire guide if you wish to contribute.

## Adding Articles

1. Please fork this repo
2. Create a new branch with the same name as the title of the article in lowercase with the words separated by hyphens, ie: `the-new-article`
3. Add your new article in the `article-source` folder with the file name the same as the branch name/title, ie: `the-new-article`
3. Create a Pull Request

## Writing Articles

New articles should follow the [standard markdown format](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#links) as seen in existing articles in the `article-source` folder: a title preceeded by '## ' (note the space after the last hashmark), an option subtitle preceeded by '### ', and then the content of the article.
